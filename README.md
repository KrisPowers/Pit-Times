​​## Pit Times - Formula 1 Statistics, Leaderboards, Standings, Videos, & More. ##

Pit Times, the largest community based, community lead Formula 1 project in the world. Pit Times provides live stats, standings, videos, leaderboards, & a load of other features for all to use.

We also provide a large list of recommended videos and news picked by our development and editors team. Videos will be picked based off of the channel who uploads the video.

### Statistics

Our statistics module, one of the most community appreciated features, is updated every race, qualification, and when penalties are applied. Our team works hard on all statistical related things due to automation not being an option at the moment.

### Leaderboards

Our leaderboards feature provides up to date leaderboards regarding the season, records and more. It is updated weekly by our team due to automation not being an option at this time.

We also provide an extentinsive database linked with our leaderboards where you can find in-depth information about each team, driver, & factor of Formula 1.


### Videos

Our video page provides a list of editor-picked videos that we recommend you watch based on Formula 1. Videos are decided by the Channel who uploaded the video and its contents.
