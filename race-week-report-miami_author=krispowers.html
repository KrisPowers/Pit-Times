            <h1>Kris Powers <span> Miami Race Week</span> Report</h1>
            <h2><span>Author: </span>Kris Powers - <span>Published: </span>05/04/2022</h2>

            <img style="width: 1290px; height: 650px; margin-top: 20px; border: #e2273c 2px solid; " src="./assets/img/miami-gp.jpg">

            <h2 style="padding-top: 40px;">With there now being under a week until our first look at the new Miami Grand Prix circuit, fans, drivers, and teams are excited equally. With the little Formula 1 & third-party game modifications have been able to show us, the circuit seems to be a one for the books. It has a unique group of streets that will surely show us a few overtakes to take place during the race on May 8th.</h2>
            
            <h2>The community itself has been having a field day regarding who they believe will come out with both hands on the Grand Prix Winners trophy. With Charles Leclerc coming out victorious in two of the four rounds this season, many favor him. A debate was started regarding the reliability of the driver behind the wheel. After the EMILIA-ROMAGNA GRAND PRIX, many are questioning whether Charles Leclerc can be relied upon to deliver, specifically under pressure. Along with Charles, many believe that Max Verstappen has a high chance of winning the Grand Prix. Although the debate of reliability goes both ways as Red Bull Racing’s engine, now known as the Red Bull PowerTrain has been proven to be unreliable after a total of five DNFs (Did not finish) spreading across Red Bull Racing & their junior team Scuderia Alphaturi.</h2>
          
            <h2>The community is also slowly becoming outraged at the fact that starting in 2023, the United States will have a total of three Grand Prix’s and possibly a 4th in 2024 or later if the FIA approves the New York City Grand Prix. Many believe that European Motorsports are becoming more American than anything else. Many fans argue that with the way the Media covers NASCAR, the American motor-racing sport, they are frightened by the idea of it going American.</h2>
          
            <h2>An article released by Planet F1 this week made the claim that McLaren F1 are currently investigating an employee of theirs  for alleged abusive messages toward the 7 time world champion and former McLaren driver, Lewis Hamilton. The contents of these messages have not been shared, but the account (Twitter) used to send these messages has since been deleted by an unknown party. All drivers do not deserve to be sent hateful comments, we can only hope this is sorted out accordingly.</h2>
          
            <h2>McLaren motor-sports as a whole has seen some of the last few weeks in Motorsports history after Lando Norris achieved a 3rd place finish at the EMILIA-ROMAGNA GRAND PRIX and Indycar driver Pato O’Ward winning the Grand Prix of Alabama. This is once again amazing work coming from a constantly growing team.</h2>
          
            <h2>Reports of the FIA debating whether or not to keep the famous Monaco Grand Prix on the calendar has been circulating the F1 community. Many drivers including Lewis Hamilton have urged the FIA to keep it on the calendar. Many questioned why they would even try to remove a Grand Prix so infamous for many things such as Senna's amazing work in 1988 proving truely how fast he was.</h2>

            <h2>Along with that, May 1st marked the 28th year since the death of drivers Ayrton Senna & Roland Ratzenberger.  At the 1994 EMILIA-ROMAGNA GRAND PRIX, tragedy struck as driver Roland Ratzenberger died suddenly. This was the result of a crash that took place. Just the day prior, another crash (unfatel) involved driver Rubens Barrichello which injured himself and others surrounding the incident. Many believed that after these two incidents, the Grand Prix should have been re-considered and changes should have been made to the track. But nonetheless, the Grand Prix went on anyway. Many mistakes led to others which then later resulted in the Death of Ayrton Senna, debatably the best F1 & possibly even Motorsports Driver ever. This swept the world by storm as the first reports appeared on the tv, many in shock, disbelief and saddened to hear of these events. The events that weekend lead to the deaths of 2 legends and nearly taking a third. Rest in Peace Aryton Senna & Roland Ratzenberger.</h2>
            
            <h2>Williams has admitted that it has been difficult to adjust to having Alex Albon as a driver. They state that they have been so used to working with now Mercedes-AMG driver George Russell. They claim that this issue is no more and to expect some good results at the Miami Grand Prix.</h2>
